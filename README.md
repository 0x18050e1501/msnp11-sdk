# msnp11-sdk
An MSNP11 client SDK written in Rust. It is WIP, but messaging and some contact actions have tests that confirm they're working. Other features like display picture transfers are present but still untested.

## Bindings
Bindings for Kotlin and Swift can be generated with [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/tutorial/foreign_language_bindings.html#multi-crate-workspaces).
